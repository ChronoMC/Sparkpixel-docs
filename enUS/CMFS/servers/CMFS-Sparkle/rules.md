# Building and Audit Specifications

## Introduction

**This specification is intended to guide players' building behavior in the SparkPixel series of services and ensure the harmony and safety of the server. All players must comply with this specification when using server resources for building activities. **

# How to participate in the audit
## 1.

## Audit Specifications

**1\. Building Permit**

- All construction projects must obtain explicit permission from the server management team before construction.

- Players can submit building plans through building application channels provided by private messages or other effective methods, including building location, design drawings, estimated completion time and other information.

**2\. Building Location and Scope**

- Buildings must be located in designated areas and must not occupy unopened or prohibited land.

- The height and scope of the building should comply with the server planning to avoid damage to the surrounding environment and resources.

**3\. Building Design**

- The architectural style should be consistent with the server environment and must not violate the server's cultural or aesthetic standards.

- Building design should avoid overly complex or unnecessary structures to reduce maintenance costs and potential safety risks.
- The building design should not contain any violation of national laws and local regulations and public order and good customs of our and your location.

**4\. Structural safety and stability**

- The building must use appropriate building materials to ensure its structural stability, support and structural rationality.

- All buildings should be regularly inspected for safety and any problems found should be repaired.

**5\. Resource utilization and environmental protection**

- During construction, damage to natural landforms and ecological environment should be avoided to protect biodiversity.

- When using or discharging any natural resources, the management team should be notified in advance.

**6\. Review process**

- After all buildings are completed, they must be submitted to the server management team for formal review.

- Before starting construction, the management team should also provide the required information, and construction can only start after the administrator agrees.

- The management team will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the building in accordance with this specification and make a decision to approve or reject it.

- If a rejection decision is made, you can make corrections within 7 days. If you refuse to cooperate, we have the right to delete your building.
- After the player submits the application, the administrator should receive the acceptance data within 7 days, collect relevant pictures on site (completed within 5 days), and hand them over to the management group for joint signing by all managers (completed within 15 days).

**7\. Violation handling**

- If the building does not obtain a permit, violates the design specifications, or has safety hazards, the management team has the right to require the immediate cessation of construction or demolition of the building.

- For players who repeatedly violate the rules, more stringent punishment measures will be taken, including but not limited to account bans.

**8\. Complaint mechanism**

- Players who disagree with the audit results have the right to appeal to the server management team.

- The appeal must provide detailed evidence and explanations so that the management team can conduct a comprehensive review.

**9\. Supplementary provisions**

- This specification will take effect from the date of publication and will be updated regularly to adapt to changes and developments in the server.

- The right to interpret this specification belongs to the server management team.

**It is the responsibility of every SparkPixel series service player to comply with this specification. We work together to maintain a healthy and orderly gaming environment. **

# Construction Specifications

## Station Construction

Stations need to be built with ![img](/img/CMFS/sparkle/5.jpg), and the two tracks need to be separated by **at least 6 grids, 8 grids are recommended**. The wider the platform, the more extra things can be placed in the middle, and the station can also be more beautiful. The style and scale of the station should be determined in the planning stage. For example, if this line is small-scale, then the station can be built simpler, with wood and pure stone as the main components of the station, without so many advanced station equipment. If the station is city-scale, then the station will look different from the outside, and the interior will also include electric escalators, elevators, information centers, etc., with a more **modern, technological** architectural style.

## Single-track and double-track construction standards (recommended standards)

Double-track example:

Single-track example:

We **do not** recommend using single-track railways because of the large intervals and scheduling issues.

## Railway construction specifications:

### 1. Evacuation platform

![img](/img/CMFS/sparkle/8.jpg)

**The evacuation platform should be less than 1 mm from the top of the track**

**(Refer to national standards)**

### 2. Turning radius

#### 1. Subway standards (all data are above)

![img](/img/CMFS/sparkle/9.png)

#### 2. 350km or less (inclusive) 200km/h or more (inclusive) high-speed railway

General **7000** meters or more, difficult **5500** meters or more

#### 2. 350km or more (excluding) 400km/h or more (inclusive) high-speed railway

General **8500** meters or more, difficult **7500** meters or more

### 3. Maximum slope

#### 1\. Subway standards

1. The slope of the main line is generally **30‰**, **35‰** for difficult lines, and **40‰** for mountainous terrain.

2. The connecting line uses **40‰**;

3. The minimum slope of the tunnel should be **3‰**, and the minimum slope for difficult lines should be **2‰**.

#### 2\. High-speed railways below (inclusive) 350km and above (inclusive) 200km/h

1. The slope of the main line should be **20‰**.

#### 2\. High-speed railways above (excluding) 350km and above (inclusive) 400km/h

1. The slope of the main line is generally **15‰**, and **20‰** for difficult lines.

### 4. Section standards:

The length of a single section should be **the longest vehicle length of the current line\* 2 \+ the longest braking distance**.

### 5. Turnaround Standards:

Just like the relationship between the siding and the platform track, the turnaround also needs to be consistent with the length of the vehicle body, otherwise, the vehicle may not be generated. For example, if the siding length is **20** grids, then the turnaround should also be designed to be **20** grids. At the same time, if the vehicle body is long (**4** marshaling or more), it is recommended to set the siding farther away from the previous station so that the train has enough space to turn and avoid vehicle penetration. The turnaround also needs to be properly decorated to enhance its formality. In addition, please use a one-way track connector to link the link between the up/down and the turnaround. This single-line track helps ensure that the train travels in the correct turnaround direction.
