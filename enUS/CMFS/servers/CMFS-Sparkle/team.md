#### Titan_hao

**Rail Transportation Director**

"I am Titan_hao, the executive director of the rail transportation system. If Goldfish draws the skeleton of the railway, my team gives it flesh and blood-from platform lighting design to train schedule optimization, from three-dimensional overpasses to undersea tunnels, we make every trip a landscape. We are currently developing a dynamic dispatching system and a fully automatic freight line, and will launch a themed sightseeing train in the future. Rail transit is not only a tool, but also a mobile business card of server culture!"
